/**
 * Durable identity of preset-managed Team members.
 *
 * The member snapshot in `./member-store.ts` is the frozen configuration, but
 * it lives in a unit this plugin opens: when that unit cannot be opened, is
 * damaged, or lost a record, the snapshot alone cannot tell a member this
 * plugin created from a native teammate. A member therefore also carries an
 * identity that the HOST persists on its own: the subagent execution backend it
 * was created through.
 *
 * This plugin registers two stable aliases in the official subagent provider
 * registry — one per configured spawn context — and summons every member
 * through them. The official Team service writes the provider name into its
 * roster row and into the child's own `subagent/descriptor`, so the child can
 * later prove it is plugin-managed even when no snapshot can be read. The
 * aliases are execution backends, never LLM routes: each one delegates the
 * whole provider contract to the deployment's own provider, so fresh/fork
 * history semantics, cancellation, and concurrency isolation are unchanged.
 *
 * Aliases therefore have to exist exactly while their upstream provider does,
 * whatever order the two plugins activate in. The registry built here is
 * self-maintaining: it scans once when it subscribes, follows
 * `subagent/provider-added` and `subagent/provider-removed` afterwards, and
 * re-validates every alias whenever its upstream may have changed. Nothing
 * about the mount order of this plugin and the provider plugins is assumed, and
 * no alias failure is remembered past the moment it stops being true.
