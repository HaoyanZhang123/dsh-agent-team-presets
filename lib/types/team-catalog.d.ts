/**
 * The single official catalog of Teams this plugin ships.
 *
 * v0.1.6 ships nine presets in two fixed series: the three original
 * research-and-development Teams and the six work-mode Teams contributed in
 * PR #1. The catalog is the authority for a fresh install, for migration, for
 * "restore defaults", and for the read-only source/series facts the Settings
 * page filters on. It is deliberately separate from the stored Team records:
 * a stored Team is the user's copy and may drift, while this catalog never
 * changes except when a plugin release changes it.
 *
 * Each entry carries its display metadata. Metadata is presentation-only and
 * is never read by the runtime composition path (see `src/types.ts`).
 * @module dsh-agent-team-presets/team-catalog
