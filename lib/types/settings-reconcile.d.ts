/**
 * Minimal, revision-fenced reconcile of this plugin's own settings document.
 *
 * One startup pass owns every repair the plugin makes to the stored Teams,
 * because they all rewrite the same `teams` array and two writers would race
 * each other's revision fence:
 *
 * - the legacy captain route, which no current schema declares,
 * - a member identity a stored record never carried,
 * - the shipped default presets, installed once per deployment.
 *
 * The pass never touches Session policy, and it writes only when a repair
 * really applies. Read-only and conflict errors are not retried for the same
 * document: the caller notifies again when the document, the Teams value, or the
 * shipped-defaults marker changes.
 * @module dsh-agent-team-presets/settings-reconcile
