/**
 * Who receives which Team Skill, and what may not be deleted.
 *
 * A Team is the organizing container, but the smallest unit that actually takes
 * effect is a member: `teamId + roleId`, with the captain stored under its own
 * role slot so a captain assignment can never be mistaken for a member's. The
 * bindings live in their own document beside the asset registry, never inside a
 * Team preset, because a role assignment is a local preference and a preset
 * document is shared.
 *
 * Deletion is guarded here rather than in the page, so the Agent-facing path
 * and the visual path cannot disagree about whether a delete is allowed. Three
 * independent reasons block it: a role still binds the asset, a live member is
 * running on it, or another asset declares it as a dependency. A text-scan hit
 * is only a warning — static scanning of Markdown and scripts cannot prove a
 * reference, and pretending otherwise would either block legitimate deletes or
 * hide a real one.
