/**
 * Canonical descriptions for the tools this plugin registers.
 *
 * One source per tool: the model-facing definition and the settings hover tip
 * show the same text, so the two can never drift into two different accounts of
 * one capability.
 *
 * Only tools this plugin implements appear here. An upstream tool keeps the
 * description its own author wrote and is never re-described here — inventing
 * hover text for someone else's tool would put unverified claims in the tip, and
 * the description is model-facing text first. These strings are deliberately
 * English only: the upstream `ToolDefinition` carries a single description with
 * no localization field, and the UI shows that same string verbatim.
