/**
 * Accent colors this plugin publishes to the Agent Teams roster.

 * A Team's configured colors live in the settings document rather than in the
 * Session log, so the browser half resolves them from the same stored Teams and
 * selections the Settings page and the composer control edit.
 *
 * The roster's appearance registry is a deployment extension rather than part of
 * official rc.2, so its shape is declared here instead of imported from a
 * package the plugin cannot depend on. A structurally identical local
 * declaration keeps this plugin compiling against the official release while a
 * deployment that ships the extension still accepts these values.
